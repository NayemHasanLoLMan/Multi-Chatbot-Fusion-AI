Ingredients:\n   - Pasta (such as spaghetti, fettuccine, or penne)\n   - Water\n   - Salt\n   - Olive oil (optional)\n   - Pasta sauce (store-bought or homemade)\n   - Desired toppings (like cheese, herbs, or vegetables)\n\n2. Instructions:\n   - Boil a pot of water with salt and a splash of olive oil.\n   - Add pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente.\n   - Drain the pasta and mix with your desired sauce and toppings.\n   - Serve hot and enjoy your pasta!\n\nAs for the cost, it can vary depending on the type of pasta, sauce, and toppings you choose. On average, a basic pasta dish can cost around $5-$10 per serving, but this can change based on ingredients and where you shop."

          "assistant": "If you only have around $3 to make a pasta dish, here are some tips:\n\n1. Choose a budget-friendly pasta: Opt for a less expensive type of pasta like spaghetti or penne.\n2. Make your own sauce: Instead of buying pre-made sauce, make your own with canned tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. This can save you money and is also healthier.\n3. Use simple toppings: Stick to basic toppings like grated Parmesan cheese or dried herbs.\n4. Cook in bulk: Cooking a larger quantity of pasta and sauce can save you money in the long run, as you can have leftovers for another meal.\n5. Buy generic brands: Generic brands of pasta and sauce are often much cheaper than name brands and are just as good.\n\nWith these tips, you can make a delicious and affordable pasta dish for around $3 or less per serving."

Add spices:\n   - Turmeric\n   - Red chili powder\n   - Garam masala\n4. Add chopped tomatoes\n5. Add cooked vegetables\n6. Mix in the cooked pasta\n7. Garnish with coriander leaves (if available)\n\nBudget tips for Indian-style pasta:\n- Buy spices from Indian grocery stores (usually cheaper)\n- Use basic vegetables like peas, carrots, or onions\n- Skip expensive ingredients like cheese\n- Make garlic-ginger paste at home\n- Use regular pasta instead of fancy varieties\n\nThis version can definitely be made within your $3 budget, especially if you already have some basic spices at home!"
